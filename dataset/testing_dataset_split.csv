/home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_02.png, How are the routers R2 and R3 connected to the internet?, "R2 and R3 are connected to the internet through routers ISP_A and ISP_B respectively, each linked by a /24 network segment."
/home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_02.png, "If a packet is sent from the router R1 to the loopback address of router R3, which path does it likely take through the network and why?","The packet from R1 to the loopback address of R3 (10.100.100.2) would travel upwards through OSPF Area 0 to R2, then continue through the network segment 10.60.60.0/24 to ISP_A. From ISP_A, the packet travels across the internet (10.70.70.0/24 and 10.50.50.0/24 segments) reaching ISP_B, and finally down to R3. This path is chosen based on OSPF cost metrics and the availability of routing information provided by OSPF and possibly other routing protocols like BGP at the ISPs, optimizing for the shortest or most efficient route."
/home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_02.png, "How would the network be affected if the link between ISP_A and R2 (10.20.20.0/24) fails, and what mechanisms might be in place to handle such a failure?","If the link between ISP_A and R2 fails, R2 would lose its direct connection to the internet via ISP_A. OSPF and BGP would then reconverge, and R2 would have to route its internet-bound traffic through R3 via the 10.60.60.0/24 network, assuming that R3 still has a valid path to the internet through ISP_B. This path rerouting helps maintain network resilience. Mechanisms like OSPF route recalculations and BGP's path selection and rerouting capabilities are essential for handling such failures, ensuring minimal disruption to network service."

It facilitates communication between these devices by forwarding data packets to the correct destinations."
/home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_35.png, Why might the TP-Link Router be set to bridge mode instead of functioning as a regular router?,"Setting the TP-Link Router to bridge mode allows it to function as a network bridge, extending the network without creating a separate subnet or performing NAT (Network Address Translation). This can be useful for simplifying network configuration and maintaining a single IP address space across the network."
/home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_35.png, Describe the potential impact on the network if the Cisco Switch fails.,"If the Cisco Switch fails, all connected devices (TP-Link Router, Windows Server 2012, Windows 7 PC, and Windows XP PC) will lose their network connectivity.
