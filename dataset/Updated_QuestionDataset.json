When a user makes a VoIP call, the data for that call is generated and sent to the Linksys router. The router then sends the data packets over the VDSL connection to the internet service provider.

The Linksys router with DD-WRT VoIP firmware would also be responsible for managing voice traffic, such as making and receiving phone calls, by using the VDSL router's voice capabilities.

The DD-WRT firmware on the Linksys router allows for advanced features and customization, which could include managing the network's Quality of Service (QoS) settings to prioritize voice traffic over other types of internet traffic. This would ensure that voice calls over the Cisco Unified 7960 IP Phone with SIP have a stable and high-priority connection, reducing the likelihood of call drops or poor call quality.

Since the PC is on the same subnet as the switch it's connected to, the traffic will first reach the switch.\n3. The switch forwards the traffic based on the destination IP address.
