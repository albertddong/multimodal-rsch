/home/user/network-diagrams/network-diagram.png, Describe the role of the TP-Link Router in this network setup., The TP-Link Router is set to Bridge Mode and provides a connection between the local network and the Cisco Switch. The router has an IP address of 10.1.10.1.
/home/user/network-diagrams/network-diagram.png, How are the devices within the computer lab connected to the larger network?, The devices within the computer lab, including the Windows 7 PC and Windows XP PC, are all connected to the Cisco Switch, which in turn connects to the TP-Link Router. This setup allows communication between the local devices and the broader network infrastructure.
/home/user/network-diagrams/network-diagram.png, What is the role of the Cisco Switch in this network configuration?, The Cisco Switch acts as a central connection point for various devices within the network, including the TP-Link Router, Windows Server 2012, Windows 7 PC, and Windows XP PC. It allows for efficient network communication and data transfer between these devices.
/home/user/network-diagrams/network-diagram.png, Explain the communication path between the Windows XP PC and the Windows Server 2012., The Windows XP PC communicates with the Windows Server 2012 through the Cisco Switch. The Windows XP PC first sends its data to the Cisco Switch, which then routes the data to the Windows Server 2012. This efficient routing allows for seamless interaction between the two devices.
/home/user/network-diagrams/network-diagram.png, How does the network address configuration support the operation of the devices?, Each device in the network is assigned a unique IP address within the 10.1.10.x subnet. For example, the TP-Link Router has the IP address 10.1.10.1, the Windows Server 2012 has 10.1.10.2, the Windows 7 PC has 10.1.10.100, and the Windows XP PC has 10.1.10.101. This addressing scheme ensures that each device can be uniquely identified and properly communicate within the network.
