/home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_02.png, What routing protocols are utilized in this network diagram, and explain the significance of each., The network diagram utilizes BGP for external routing between the Internet, ISP_A, and ISP_B routers, and OSPF for internal routing within the Inside network. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is used for routing between different autonomous systems (ASNs 200, 300, 400), ensuring efficient and reliable communication between distinct administrative domains. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is used internally for the Inside network, providing fast convergence and efficient path selection within the autonomous system AS 100. OSPF's Area 0 serves as the backbone area, ensuring optimal routing within the Inside network.

/home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_02.png, How do the ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers) contribute to the network's routing policies, and which routers are associated with each ASN?, The ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers) are critical for defining distinct administrative boundaries and implementing specific routing policies between those domains. In this network, the Internet router is associated with ASN 400, ISP_A router with ASN 200, ISP_B router with ASN 300, and the Inside routers (R_1, R_2, R_3) with ASN 100. These ASNs help in the exchange of routing information and ensure compliant and controlled network traffic flow between different parts of the network, leveraging BGP for inter-AS routing and OSPF for intra-AS routing.

   **Response:** SW1 can reach the Internet by first sending packets to the Core router through its Fa0/24 interface with the IP address 192.168.123.1. The Core router, which has an internal interface IP address of 192.168.123.3, will then route the traffic from its Fa0/0 interface to its Fa0/1 interface. Finally, from the Core's Fa0/1 interface, the traffic will be sent to the Internet through the IP address 146.185.130.223.

3. **Image Path:** /home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_03.png

   **Response:** SW2 can synchronize its time by sending NTP requests to pool.ntp.org at the IP address 146.185.130.223. The request would route from SW2's Fa0/24 interface (192.168.123.2) to the Core router (192.168.123.3) via Fa0/0. The Core router will forward this request to the Internet via Fa0/1. The response from pool.ntp.org will follow the reverse path, allowing SW2 to have its time synchronized correctly.

5. **Image Path:** /home/albert/multimodal-rsch-master/multimodal-rsch/network-pictures/valid_03.png
   **Question:** How is the network structured in terms of connectivity and routing?
   **Response:** The network is structured in a hierarchical model. At the top level, there is the Core router connected to the Internet via its Fa0/1 interface to the IP address 146.185.130.223 (pool.ntp.org). The Core router also has an internal interface Fa0/0 with the IP address 192.168.123.3 connecting to the internal network of 192.168.123.0/24. Within this internal network, there are two switches, SW1 and SW2, connected via their Fa0/24 interfaces to the subnet with IP addresses 192.168.123.1 and 192.168.123.2 respectively. Thus, SW1 and SW2 route traffic through the Core router to access both internal and external networks.Below are five question-answer pairs for the given network diagram in the specified format:
